# Resources for a Resource-Saving Internet
**An English translation of [korayer's RE;FERI](https://referi.de)**

---

## Description

A while ago, I stumbled upon korayer's RE;FERI, a site that both conveyed information about the environmental impact of the web, as well as resources to create visually pleasing sites without Javascript and other complex, resource-intensive technologies. Most notably, it provides a template for a CSS grid system that allows the user to create more complex layouts than vanilla HTML provides for.

To make this a better reference for myself, as well as for others that speak English rather than German, I opted to translate the site. **Disclaimer, I am not a German speaker. This translation has been done partially with Google Translate, as well as simply reconstructing the original author's intent.**

The best way to learn more is to simply [check out the site](https://referi.ineedmore.coffee)!
