# Template

This folder contains the files necessary to create your own website using the framework outlined here.

## `index.html`

This is the document you need to modify to create your own website. A few paragraphs have already been provided for reference. Open the file in a browser to preview it. If you don't know how to write HTML yet, Mozilla has a great resource on how to get started [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics).

## `grid.css` and `grid-12.css`

Both of these files contain the CSS grid system that allows for more complex layouts and arrangements of items. `grid.css` (what `index.html` is set to use by default) uses an 8-column grid, while `grid-12.css` is a version with a 12 column grid.

`<cell span=3>` creates a cell that is 3 columns long. If there is no space for it in the current line, it flows over to the next line. `<cell span=5-8>` creates a cell starting in the 5th column and ending in the 8th column.

## `info.md`

The file you're reading right now.
